# About Me

Hello there, I am GenecroMarX! You can call me Necro for short, or even Marky, I guess. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I am an aspiring graphic designer, I play video games, and I also develop Minecraft: Bedrock Edition add-ons! I made this website for the sole purpose of making a more personal space for my creations.
