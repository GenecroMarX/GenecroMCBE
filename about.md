# About Me

Hello there, I am GenecroMarX! You can call me Necro for short, or even Marky, I guess. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I am an aspiring graphic designer, I play video games, and I also develop Minecraft: Bedrock Edition add-ons! You can see most of my works officially at my [MCPEDL Page](https://mcpedl.com/zachmc/).

I made this website to create a more personal space for my creations.



## Socials

Here are my active social media accounts! _I suck at managing socmeds, it's better to head to my Discord server to contact me_
