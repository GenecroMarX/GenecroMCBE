# About Me

Hello there, I am GenecroMarX! You can call me Necro for short, or even Marky, I guess. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I am an aspiring graphic designer, I play video games, and I also develop Minecraft: Bedrock Edition add-ons! You can see most of my works with Minecraft: Bedrock Edition officially at my [MCPEDL Page](https://mcpedl.com/user/zachmc/).

I made this website to create a more personal space for my creations.

## Socials

Here are my active social media accounts! _I suck at managing socmeds, it's better to head over to my Discord server to contact me_

## Buy me some Coffee!

It'd be really appreciated if someone were to [buy me a cup of coffee](https://ko-fi.com/genecromarx#paypalModal). This will help motivate myself to do better and achieve goals from furhter beyond! (っ＾▿＾)っ
