# About Me

Hello there, I am NecroMarX! You can call me Necro for short, or even Marky, I guess. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I am an aspiring graphic designer and game developer. I created this website for the sole purpose of providing a personal space for myself and my creations that anyone interested can see!

<br>

## Socials

I have a [LinkTree]({{ site.linktree }}), but these are my most active social media accounts! (●´ω｀●)

-     <a href="{{ site.twitter }}" target="_blank">Twitter</a><br>
-     <a href="{{ site.youtube }}" target="_blank">YouTube</a><br>
-     <a href="{{ site.tiktok }}" target="_blank">TikTok</a>

<br>

## Business Inquiries

In case you (or a friend) are looking for someone to work with, below are my portfolios where I often publish my projects that are out of GitHUB. I am a freelancer and I do paid commissions. If you are interested in working with me, I am always available on my [Twitter]({{ site.twitter }}) and Discord! ({{ site.discord }}) ヽ(゜∇゜)ノ


### My Portfolios

## Buy me some Coffee!

It'd be really appreciated if you support me by <a href="{{ site.kofi }}" target="_blank">buying me a cup of coffee</a>. This will help motivate myself to do better, provide services of better quality, and achieve goals from furthr beyond! (っ＾▿＾)っ
